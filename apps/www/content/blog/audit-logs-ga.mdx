[Earlier this year](https://www.unkey.com/changelog#2024-01-19), we introduced audit logs as a beta feature in the Unkey dashboard, meaning that they were an opt-in
feature for beta testers. They're now generally available to all Pro customers.

Navigating to the [audit logs page](https://app.unkey.com/audit/) in the Unkey dashboard, you'll see a live feed of all of the events that have 
occured in your Unkey workspace, from all your users. 

For example, if you invited a new teammate to your workspace and they proceeded to create a new key, verify it, and 
add ratelimiting to their account, you'll see that in the audit logs - along with location and timestamp.

This feature is primarily geared towards our larger users: several software regulations - for instance, GDPR and SOCII -
require audit logging. So this feature unlocks the ability to use Unkey for our compliance-conscious-customers!

There are two other primary reasons why audit logs are important:

- **Security**: logging user actions helps to prevent and mitigate security breaches
- **Debugging**: having a historical record of events in your workspace can be useful for time-travel debugging, just like your git history is

Audit Logs are a feature of our Pro tier, which costs $25 per month. If you'd like to access audit logs, you can [upgrade
to Pro](https://app.unkey.com/settings/billing) via the dashboard. The Pro tier comes with a 90-day retention period for
audit logs.

If you need an audit log retention period longer than 90 days, you can [contact us](https://www.unkey.com/pricing) to discuss your needs.

See our [documentation](https://www.unkey.com/docs/audit-log/introduction) for how to get started.
